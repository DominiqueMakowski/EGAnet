Description: An implementation of the Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA). EGA is part of a new area called network psychometrics,
            that focuses on the estimation of undirected network models to psychological datasets. EGA estimates the number of
            dimensions or factors using graphical lasso or TMFG and a weighted network community analysis. A bootstrap method for
            verifying the stability of the estimation is also available. The fit of the structure suggested by EGA can be
            verified using confirmatory factor analysis and a direct way to convert the EGA structure to CFA is also
            implemented. Documentation and examples are available.
